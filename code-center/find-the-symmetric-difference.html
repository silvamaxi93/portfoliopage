            <h3>This is what the exercise ask for:</h3>
            <p>
                The mathematical term symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets but not in both. 
                For example, for sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}, A ? B = {1, 4}.
                Symmetric difference is a binary operation, which means it operates on only two elements. 
                So to evaluate an expression involving symmetric differences among three elements (A ? B ? C), you must complete one operation at a time. 
                Thus, for sets A and B above, and C = {2, 3}, A ? B ? C = (A ? B) ? C = {1, 4} ? {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
                Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of their symmetric difference. 
                The returned array must contain only unique values (no duplicates).
